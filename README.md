Analysis of trends and current amounts of protected lands and waters in B.C.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A set of R scripts to complete the analysis behind the Environmental Indicator [Protected Lands & Waters in B.C.](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/protected-lands-and-waters.html), published by [Environmental Reporting BC](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FF80E0B985F245CEA62808414D78C41B) in June 2016.

### Data

The analysis uses data from several sources; they should be downloaded and stored in the `data` folder:

-   [Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (CCEA) shapefile database of protected areas in Canada](http://www.ccea.org/download-carts-data/)
-   [B.C. Government Conservation Lands](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/68327529-c0d5-4fcb-b84e-f8d98a7f8612) (Licence: [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61))
-   [B.C. NGO Conservation Areas Database â€” Fee Simple Areas](http://ltabc.ca/resources/2012-02-05-22-20-02)
-   [Ecoregions - Ecoregion Ecosystem Classification of British Columbia](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d00389e0-66da-4895-bd56-39a0dd64aa78) (Licence: [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61))
-   [Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) Map](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/f358a53b-ffde-4830-a325-a5a03ff672c3) (Licence: [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61))

### Code

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis; they need to be run in order:

-   `01_load.R` - unzips the data files in the data folder
-   `02_clean.R` - cleans and prepares the spatial data for analysis, especially resolving overlaps among types of protected area designations
-   `03_analysis.R` - performs the spatial intersections and creates data summaries
-   `04_plot.R` - creates plots for communicating the results

The file `fun.R` contains a few custom functions required for the analysis.

#### Required R packages:

Spatial packages:

    sp
    rgdal
    rgeos
    raster
    maptools
    geojsonio
    bcmaps
    rmapshaper

General data manipulation packages:

    dplyr
    tidyr
    readr

Plotting packages:

    ggplot2
    RColorBrewer
    ggthemes
    envreportutils

Most packages used in the analysis can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`, but there are a few you will need to install using devtools:

``` r
install.packages("devtools") # If you don't already have it installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/envreportutils")
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
```

#### Other required software

You will also need the [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) node package, and for this you will require Node.js to be installed. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/), then on the command line type:

    npm install -g mapshaper
